- when an event is emitted, event handlers are called **synchronously**
- can register handlers with `on` or with `once`
- if an `error` event is emitted but there are no handlers, it will be trhown as an exception - which means the stack trace will be printed, and `node` will crash
- to avoid that, it is best practice to **always register handlers for `error`**
- by default, max 10 handlers can be registered for an event; can change with `emitter.setMaxListeners(100)`
- to change the max for all `EventEmitter` instances, use `EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners = 100`
