- event loop base premise: most waste comes from waiting for I/O ops to complete
- threads: overhead, sharing is complex (nginx vs apache)
- event loop: converts external events into callback invocations
- event loop: picks events from the event queue and pushes their callbacks onto the call stack
- js is single threaded, so only one stack, and can only do one thing at a time
- stack frame: fn, args, local vars
